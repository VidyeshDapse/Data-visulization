# Data Visualization
# Question:
Select datasets from https://data.gov.in/ and create
(a) a scatter plot,
(b) a box plot, and
(c) a bar or line plot from them using mathplotlib library.

# Observations:
## Box plot

1. Among all Food grains Bajra is having highest (8500 Tonnes) median value while Ragi having lowest (2000 Tonnes) median value.
2. IQR tells us the spread of Jowar,Bajra and Other Pulses for middle 50% is higher compare to Ragi and Tur. 
3. Jowar follows left skewed distribution (median > mean) while Bajra and Other Pulses follow right skewed distribution (mean > median) means there is less frequency of very low production of Jowar and very high production of Bajra and Other Pulses.
4. Distribution for Ragi and Tur is very narrow means production is spread over small range of values.
5. There are some outliers present in data signifying very high or very low production over years.

## Line plot

1. Over all the years production of Ground-nuts and Rapeseed & Mustard is high compare to production of Sesamum and Castor seed.
2. We can see zigzag pattern for Ground nuts production as there is consecutively decrease and then increase going on.
3. There is increase in Rapeseed & Mustard production from 2002-2005 but again it follow zigzag trend over consecutive years.
4. We can see stable pattern in production of Sesamum and Castor seed as from 2001-2016 there is not much fluctuations in production i.e for Castor seed there is increase in production from 2002 till it get peak at 2011 while there is almost stagnent production for Sesamum over the years.

## Scatter plot

1. We notice that the clustering of data points tends to move up from left to right. The growth is not extreme, but there is a clear upward movement. 
2. There is almost positive linear correlation between oilseeds and food grains because as production of food grains increases there is increase in oilseeds production.
3. There are 2 outliers points which deviates from remaining data points.
